<p>This is a simple shopping website system.</p>

<h3>Why?</h3>
<p>I build this for demonstracting the use of basic PHP, HTML and MySQL to my friend.</p>

<h3>Framework?</h3>
<p>This system is no-framework.</p>

<h3>MySQL function?</h3>
<p>The function used for MySQL is the basic one: $mysqli->query.</p>
<p>No preprare statement, no POD in this system.</p>

<h3>How about JavaScript?</h3>
<p>Not too much. I exclude the ajax function. I just use some basic script like "alert".</p>

<p>The connect_db.php file is removed due to privacy.</p>
